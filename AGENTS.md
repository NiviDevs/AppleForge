* This is a hackathon project, and the pronlem statement is as follows

Life-Critical Healthcare Systems:
Design a fault-tolerant healthcare system architecture that ensures continuous and safe operation during energy instability or system failure. The solution should incorporate energy-aware system design, intelligent prioritization, and autonomous or predictive decision logic. Teams must demonstrate how W3 principles—such as decentralization, verifiable execution, or distributed control—can improve system reliability, auditability, and decision transparency in life-critical healthcare environments.
